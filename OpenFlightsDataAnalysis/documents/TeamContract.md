# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings**
We plan to have team meetings once a week (This is the plan for now, subject to change if there's a need for additional group meetings). Each meeting will be around 30 - 45 minutes & we’ll discuss what we have completed & what we need to work on next. We don't believe we need meeting notes. We'll meet on Discord or in-person if we need to.

2. **Assistance**
Teammates can message each other in the group Discord chat if they require assistance or opinions. During daytime hours a 2 hour response time should be maximum.

3. **Respect**
Teammates are allowed to voice their opinions or concerns on Discord or in-person. Teammates are expected to ensure all group members are treated with respect & that all teammates' voices are heard. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution**
We’ll assign work on Google Sheets & make sure the team's workload is divided fairly. Teammates should report it immediately if they address any unexpected complications or unforeseen work on Discord. 

5. **Time Commitment**
Each team meeting will be expected to last anywhere from 30 - 45 minutes. Outside of team meetings, there’ll be a Google document shared with the group members where they’ll be able to list the current task they’re working on & how long it might take them to complete the task & if or not they require any assistance in order to complete the task. In the situation that there arises an emergency or conflict, the teammate facing the conflict shall let the group know through the Discord server & the group members will then attempt. 

6. **Conflict Resolution**
In case of a dispute or disagreement amongst team members, the group will attempt to resolve the issue by talking about it amongst ourselves & trying to resolve it by establishing a common ground for the members to be able to communicate respectfully. If a group member is unable to accomplish their tasks then other members will reach out to the group member & discuss what might be causing the member(s) to not accomplish their respectful tasks & provide assistance or resources that might serve as aid to the member(s) so that they can accomplish their tasks in a timely manner. Being punctual & on time are key components of success in a group setting. If a member is constantly late to team meetings then the group members may discuss a better time to meet that fits the schedule of all group members without causing any major delays in team meetings. We hope to discuss all plans for the upcoming week in our weekly meetings (Which will probably be held on Sundays) which serve as a progress check-in & also as a method of communication between team members so that everyone is on the same page. In situations where conflicts aren’t resolved despite team communication & efforts, the team will seek guidance from the team mentor &/or another course staff member.
